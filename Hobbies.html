            <p>
                Table tennis is a thrilling, fast-paced sport that tests reflexes and precision. 
                Played on a small table with a lightweight ball, it demands quick reactions and strategic shot placement.
                I enjoy the challenge of anticipating my opponent's moves and perfecting my spins and smashes. 
                Playing with friends makes it even more fun, as every rally is a chance to showcase skill and agility.
